iSENSE Simon
------------
This is a simple game of [Simon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)) made using MIT's App Inventor. After playing a round, it allows the user to upload their score to [an iSENSE project for this game](https://isenseproject.org/projects/1371).

The only known bug with the game is that if the player presses two buttons in quick succession, the sound will not play for the second press, but the press will still register in-game. This is due to the way that App Inventor plays sound effects and cannot be fixed in the current incarnation of the game.
