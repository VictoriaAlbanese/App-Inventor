This is the code to change the year when published, so that it is stored in iSENSE for the same year as the year for data comparison. (The year you want it published as can be selected in the settings screen.)

This code is different from the other screens, since the other screens can simply return the thumbposition for the result. The code had to be sperated because of the large scale for nitrates, and is accurate to the nearest .5 from 0 to 10 mg/L, and then to the nearest 5 from 10 to 50 mg/L.
